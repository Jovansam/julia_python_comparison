    "1. Python is massively popular for both general purpose and scientific computing (see, e.g., [this ranking](https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2018)).  Its popularity is partly due to (and partly caused by) the huge range of third party libraries.  Within the scientific domain, these libraries include high quality array processing software and a powerful JIT compiler.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python's primary scientific JIT compiler (Numba) and Julia's JIT compiler are built on the same architecture (LLVM).  Similar execution times are to be expected.  From this perspective it is surprising that the Python code runs faster on this machine.  Other users are likely to get slightly different relative run times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AFV do not display any profiling of their codes in the different languages. No memory footprint, no flop rates, etc. are shown. This matters because memory access patterns can always be optimized, especially in small problems as treated here.  One would have to take into account all the individual features of the programming languages to make a fair comparison. (Most likely there would be no surprise, as their performance behavior is known.)  A useful refernence is: S. Goedecker and A. Hoisie. Performance Optimization of Numerically Intensive Codes (SIAM), 2001. ISBN 978-0898714845. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. As an aside, the author thinks Julia is a great project and hopes that it succeeds.  Python wouldn't be where it is now without the flow of ideas (and competitive pressure) from Julia.\n"

    "Another claim of the paper is that \"Julia benefits a lot from a mild investment on optimization and makes it easier to compare with `Numba` and `Cython`, which require extra work as well with respect to basic Python\". The evidence they provide actually supports the opposite claim. After adapting their original code to Python 3, it turns out that only two lines need to be added (and a few of their inconsistencies deleted) to get `Numba` to run: `from numba import jit` and `@njit`. Not only is this extremely easy, but it is also much less work than AVF put into trying to optimize their Julia code, which can be partially observed by looking at the history of the file [here](https://github.com/jesusfv/Comparison-Programming-Languages-Economics/commits/master/RBC_Julia.jl). For timing purposes, we also remove the print statements, and add a warm-up period. We run the new code in the cell below."
